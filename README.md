# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective
To build classification models using Decision Tree and Random Forest on a binary classification dataset.

## Dataset
Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (as a placeholder for Heart Disease dataset).

## Steps:
1. Loaded and split the dataset.
2. Applied feature standardization.
3. Trained and evaluated a Decision Tree classifier.
4. Visualized the tree structure.
5. Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier.
6. Displayed top feature importances.
7. Calculated cross-validation accuracy.

## Results:
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** ~94.7%
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** ~96.5%
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy:** ~95.6%

## Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
